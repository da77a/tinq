<p>Qeo is the revolutionary communication framework from QEO LLC that interconnects devices and applications of all brands.</p>
<p> Today's connected home is fragmented. Diverse networks, multiple platforms, technologies and ecosystems, a plethora of devices and in and out of home access to different clouds, lead to complexity rather than simplicity. Qeo is a communication framework made of a core set of modules from which can be developed fully-fledged software solutions for consumer devices in order to realize a full interoperability between them. Some of these modules can also be added to existing software solutions to maximize interconnections. Technicolor delivery Technologies brings such a Qeo solution to the Android framework by offering Qeo for Android which allows you to run Qeo-enabled applications on any Android device.</p>
