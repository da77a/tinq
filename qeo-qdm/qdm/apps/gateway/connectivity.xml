      The goal of this QDM is to provide information about the WAN IP addresses
      of a gateway device. This information is often useful to devices sitting
      behind the gateway, that need to advertise the gateway's IP address to
      some outside entity.

      For example, a TR-069 agent on a set-top box may need the gateway's WAN
      IP address to correctly send INFORM messages to the ACS.  Note that a
      gateway may have multiple WAN IP addresses, not all of which are truly
      public IP addresses: there may for example be a separate (logical)
      management IP interface towards the operator's network that receives a
      WAN IP address in the 10.0.0.0 range.

      In order for clients to determine which published WAN IP address is the
      right one for their purposes, we provide a hint system. Clients can
      publish a WanIpAddressHint object that describes the IP address or
      fully-qualified domain name of an outside (i.e. at the WAN side of the
      gateway) device that must be able to reach the gateway.
      The gateway must then add each of the hints to the foreignAddresses list
      of the corresponding WanIpAddress object.

        For each WAN IP address assigned to a logical IP interface on the 
        gateway, a WanIpAddress instance is published. The instance is alive
        for as long as the IP address is assigned to that interface. When the
        IP address is no longer assigned to the interface, the corresponding
        WanIpAddress instance is removed.

          The device ID (as published on the DeviceInfo topic) of the gateway
          publishing this WAN IP address.
          This information is mainly useful in the case that multiple gateways
          are part of the same Qeo Realm. Clients can then use the information
          provided by the device discovery QDM
          (org::qeo::networking::devicediscovery) to determine which gateway is
          the one they are interested in.

        Address hints provide a way for clients to figure out which of the
        published WAN IP addresses is the right one for them.
        A client publishes a hint containing the IP address or FQDN of an
        outside host that must be able to reach them, and the gateway will
        add this hint to the foreignAddresses list of the correct WanIpAddress
        instance.
        The hint is published as a state: if the WanIpAddressHint instance is
        removed, the hint itself will be removed from the WanIpAddress instance
        as well.

          A foreign IP address or FQDN can be supplied as a hint to assist the
          WAN IP address providers in annotating the right instance.
