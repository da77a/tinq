# The MediaGEN build environment relies on small makefiles, called .env files,
# that describe how we need to build for a certain target architecture. These
# .env files are stored in the build directory in the subdirectory
# supported_targets. 
#
# This shell script can be used to create a configure script that can in turn
# be used to create an .env file for a new architecture. This .env file will be
# called configure.env and will be placed in the supported_targets directory. 
# 
# Furthermore, this shell script will also generate a small wrapper Makefile
# around Makefile_component, that behaves more like a standard automake
# makefile (i.e. install does a devel_install), a distclean target is added.

# Canonicalize the path to this script 
EXE=`readlink -f $0`
# Store the working directory
CALLING_DIR=`pwd`
